## Equations, Concepts & Theorems

### **Medium_1**:

##

### **Medium_2**
  - **Morse Code**:

##

    

### **Medium 4**:

  - Standard deviation formula:


      $$
    \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \text{mean})^2 }
      $$


    - where
      - \( N \) is the total number of data points  
      - \( x_i \) is each individual data point  
      - \( \text{mean} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i \)
     

        
  - Relative Standard Deviation:

## ðŸ“¼ Approach & Thought Process


### ***Bash scripting***
  ***Learnings***:
  
  ![rsd vs filter](https://github.com/fida22/Mars_task1/blob/d63f3bffb14dfb77fabedc09bc1d5755b2b12550/photos_for_readme/bashscirpting%20learning.jpg)
  


### 1) ***Medium_1***
  - ***Interpretation of Given Data*** :
     
    - `x, y, z` coordinates are given as input.
    - `z` coordinate is taken as the **height**.
    - `y` represents **forward and backward** movement.
    - `x` represents **left and right** movement.

  - ***Reasoning*** :

    - The `y` coordinate may contain **error** because the **camera is mounted at the front**, but the rover should rotate **when its center** reaches the marker.
      
  - ***Final Output*** :
    
    - Therefore, we **adjust the y coordinate** by an **offset value of 55**.

    we can find the distance between camera and marker using euclidean distance formula


##
### 2) ***Medium_2***
  - ***Interpretation of Given Data*** :
     
    - Morse code is stored in a dictonary named morse_dict
    - The message is split into words using split function giving 7 spaces as paramater to split
    - The words are again split into letters using the split function giving 3 spaces as parameter to split
    

  - ***Reasoning*** :

    - Traveresed thorugh each letter
    - checked weather if the morse code of the letter is found in dictonary keys
    - if yes returned the english equivalend
    - and added it to the result string
      
  - ***Final Output*** :
    
    - returned the result string

    note: Main function was not included since the question was to write a funciton

##

### 3) ***Medium_3***
  - ***Interpretation of Given Data*** :
     
    - The given input message was converted to upper case

  - ***Reasoning*** :

    - Traversed through each letter
    - took its ascii value
    - reduced the ascii value by its position value
    - converted it back to charecter
      
  - ***Final Output*** :
    
    - The result was stored in a list , so converted it back to string

##

### 4) ***Medium_4***
  - ***Interpretation of Given Data*** :

    - A set of data was given in log.txt
    - extracted the data using file handling in python and stored it in list name data
    - `y` represents **forward and backward** movement.
    - `x` represents **left and right** movement.

  - ***Reasoning*** :

    - Included Three function One for Sanchiko filter , Other for Muchiko filter and other to determine which filter to use
    - Muchiko filter
      - using sliding window technique and deque from collections module computed average using a window size of 3 and added the results to smoothed data list
    - Sanchiko filter
      - using sliding window technique and deque created the window sorted it into ascending oreder and found the median and added the results to smoothed data list
    - Which filter to use
      - Calculated the RSD value
      - if its between 1 to 10 use Muchiko
      - if its between 10 to 30 use Hybrid
      - if it greater than 30 check for z score
      - if spike is found use Sanchiko
      - else use Muchiko  
      
  - ***Final Output*** :
    
    - Smoothed data and Filter used is returned
   

##

### 5) ***Medium_5***
  - ***Interpretation of Given Data*** :
     
    - Assuming the input is in degree converted it into radians
   
  - ***Reasoning*** :

    - Calculated the half angles and computed the quternions using the formula
      
  - ***Final Output*** :
    
    - The quaternion cordinates were returned
      
##

### 1) ***Hard_1***
  - ***Interpretation of Given Data*** :
     
    - obstacle cordinates where taken from sample.txt file using python file handling functions
    - each row is considered as one obstacle
    - stored the obstacle cordinates in a list
      
  - ***Reasoning*** :

    - To create the map The largest value is found from the obstacle cordinate and
    - created a map double the size of it because brick is in the center and it can move in both the directions
    - intialised the map with 1 
    - The net movement in the vertical direction will be North - South
    - The net movement in the horizontal direction will be East -west
    - The middle cordinates will be [n,n]
    - the exact cordinate of obstacle will be
      - row: n - (north-south)
      - column: n + (east-west)
    - equated that cordinate to zero
      
  - ***Final Output*** :
    
    - The map is printed
